          <p className="sub-heading">Just a few reflections, slightly overstated. Take them for what they're worth. What I've observed from people coming to me from tutoring.</p>

          <h2>I. Too many of you guys don't realize that the real world is going to try to get in the way of your LSAT studies and that it's going to succeed in doing so.</h2>
          
          <p><strong>The real world is going to get in the way.</strong></p>
          
          <p>You can't avoid that. It's going to happen. You can be aware of that, and you can account for that in scheduling your studies.</p>
          
          <p>I've heard countless times, "The biggest thing in my life over the next three months is the LSAT," and every time I hear it I always believe it. But, paradoxically, that can be true and yet the LSAT can still be the first thing to get tossed out the window when something unexpected comes up. The car breaks down, or someone has to go to the hospital, or your old best friend comes back to town. You can't ignore these things. And they are going to eat time out of your schedule. But you're not going to choose to give up eating meals, or sleeping, or going to your job, or going to school. The LSAT truly remains BOTH the biggest thing in your life over those months AS WELL AS the first thing to get kicked to the curb when the unexpected happens. You're not going to fail a quiz, or get a lowered grade for not attending to your LSAT studies on any given day.</p>
          
          <p>What students need to know is that the unexpected will happen, and often the LSAT studies will have to be dropped—or at least minimized— for times. And that they need to be aware of that before it happens, so that they can plan for it. People need enough time budgeted into their study schedule to deal with the unexpected. The worst thing that can happen by doing this this is that people are ready for their LSAT ahead of schedule. The worst thing that can happen by not doing this is that the LSAT studies inadvertently get left behind because there's not enough time to deal with them.</p>
          
          <p>The real world will try to get in the way. It's going to succeed. Know that and prepare for that, and it won't be a problem for you.</p>

          <h2>II. Way too many of you guys believe this is an IQ test.</h2>
          
          <p>It isn't. It's a test of learned skill. Is there some correlation between level of intelligence and the most extreme scores possible on the test? Yeah, to some extent, probably. But that's like saying chess is a game of "intelligence" or basketball is a game of "height." For any two individuals of different levels of intelligence (or height) who both put in the same level of work, the same degree of training, the same level of commitment and mental focus, the smarter (or taller) one will probably do somewhat better. Sure. But put a trained chess player of average intelligence up against a genius with no training, and the average player will mop up the board with the genius. Put a short, trained, point guard against some random tall person on the basketball court, and the random is going to get smoked. The fact that intelligence may play some role at the extremes of the LSAT scores is used by way too many people to convince themselves that they can't come close to getting the score that they want.</p>

          <h2>III. Almost always you guys ignore the fundamentals.</h2>
          
          <p>Most students who seek me out have learned of premises and premises, and of arguments and assumptions, and Parallel questions, and Principle questions, and yet approach every single question the same way: "Well, I read it, and then sometimes I look for a conclusion, and then I think about it, and then I go to the answer choices and choose one that looks good." All the LSAT information they've learned ends up being a form of "LSAT trivia": factoids to be memorized that aren't cobbled together into a cohesive actionable set of tools for solving problems. What's the algorithm for working with sufficient assumptions? What about for strengthen questions? What should you do first, second, and third when you don't understand something?</p>
          
          <p>When properly understood, the fundamentals give you a set of things to do in a specific order. And too many students totally overlook this.</p>

          <h2>IV. Even when you guys learn the fundamentals you don't internalize the fundamentals.</h2>
          
          <p>I wanna be crystal clear about this. When someone takes the time to learn about conditional reasoning, and how and why it's used, and then memorizes the indicator words for conditional reasoning, so that they can work with any conditional reasoning problem to get it right... yeah! That's great! But it's not enough, not for most of you. It's nice, and it's admirable, and it puts you several steps ahead of most people.</p>
          
          <p>But I have the philosophy that we don't want you to have problems that you can work with, we don't want you to have problems that you always have a chance of solving, we want you to have problems that you can't possibly get wrong.</p>
          
          <p>If you have a tough question late in the test, and you've determined that the right answer has the form of "If X, then Y," you shouldn't happy if you CAN work with the answer choices of:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>X, if not Y</li>
            <li>only if X, Y</li>
            <li>only if not Y, X</li>
            <li>not X, if not Y</li>
            <li>X unless Y</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>...but it takes you 20 to 30 seconds and you get it right only 85% of the time. EVERYONE can have these concepts on lockdown. This takes no intelligence at all. It only takes a little elbow grease.</p>
          
          <p>You, right now, in the future, you sit there taking the test, right now in the future, future you is sitting there taking the LSAT on test day. And the question you got to ask yourself is, "Do I deserve to be the person who can work with those answer choices and can think through them to get them right? Or do I deserve to be the person who immediately sees the right answer choice and can't possibly get them wrong?"</p>
          
          <p>I think future you deserves to have these skills completely internalized. But I can't give future you that, only you can. You just have to understand that there's a difference between memorizing these concepts (which, again, is great) and having them so deeply internalized you can't get them wrong.</p>

          <h2>V. You guys don't go back over the questions you got wrong often enough.</h2>
          
          <p>It's great when you get a question right, but those questions aren't that interesting to me. My baseline assumption is that any given student should be able to get any question right. And that's why I love the questions that students get wrong.</p>
          
          <p>Any question a student gets wrong, to my way of thinking, is a question they didn't NEED to get wrong. But they did. And so I love the questions that students get wrong. They're little golden ingots. They're a cornucopia of LSAT wealth. There's a little key inside each one of them that can unlock future improvement. All we need to do is to figure out why you got that one wrong, and then go back and re-do those</p>

          <h2>VI. Reddit/r/LSAT is great, but take care of your mental health. It can be a bizarre, warped reflection of reality.</h2>
          
          <p>It can be super toxic. But it's also a great resource, so I'm not saying not to come here. But this place can really mess with your mind, and it's not healthy to spend too much time lurking here.</p>
          
          <p>I was here when this place was a wasteland and I was the only person posting. No one was coming to Reddit for LSAT content back then. So I've seen the evolution of this place. Then Graeme came along and made it what it is today, and he's done a wonderful job with this subreddit, he deserves every bit of credit. So the unreality of this place doesn't come from the top down.</p>
          
          <p>But the unreality doesn't come from a bad user base, either. It comes from a supportive community, one that wants to do well, so very, very, much. It comes pretty much entirely inadvertently.</p>
          
          <p>See, it's an aspirational thing. The LSAT's hard, and people want those top scores SO badly. And so the higher the score people post, the more rewarding it is to see that person do so well, so those posts get really highly upvoted. (And kudos to those who achieve them! Well done!) (And well done to everyone that upvoted them. Honestly! Solidarity is fantastic.)</p>
          
          <p>That being said, roughly half of test-takers score a 150 or under. For many of them, that's AFTER studying. That means, numerically there are VASTLY more people whose heroic efforts have brought their scores from the 130s to the 150s than there are people heroically going from the 150s to the 170s. For every person who beat their brains out to get a 17x, there are dozens of people with equally monumental gains, but whose scores are lower. Same amount of work, same effort, same score leap, same joy, but much lower score. Dozens of impressive hard-won 150s for every hard-won 170s score. But the top level upvoted posts? They're disproportionately 170-level scores.</p>
          
          <p>Totally understandable. Again, it's an aspirational thing. These "I just scored 17x!" posts inspire people. And often in good ways. Some people use these to fuel their studies. But what these posts can also often do is inspire dread. Inferiority. Self-attack. Resignation. "That person just scored a 178, and they laid out what they claim is the ideal study plan, and it only took them 6 weeks. So... what the fuck is wrong with ME?"</p>
          
          <p>These posts further inspire a sense of unreality. And you don't have to believe in that unreality for the pervasiveness of it to creep inside and affect you.</p>
